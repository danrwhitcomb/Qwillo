# Qwillo
A subject based reference aggregator.
Designed and built by Dan Whitcomb

Qwillo is designed to help people get to quickly get to the information they need. Users can submit topics they would like to learn about, and other users can submit links are references for the topic. Users can then mark if they found the links helpful or useless! The crowd-sourcing design allows the best references rise to the top, allowing people to easily find what they are looking for instead of wastnig time trying to figure out the right thing to search on Google.

Qwillo is currently in development. If you are interested in getting in contact with us, you can email qwillowebapp@gmail.com.
